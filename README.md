# Deuna Payment

Deuna Payment is a payment gateway that allows you to accept payments from your customers.

## Structure

The project is divided into 3 microservices:

1. [auth](./auth): It's a pretty simple microservice that generates JWT tokens and validates them.
2. [bank](./bank): It's a microservice that simulates a bank. It allows get accounts and transfers between them.
3. [gatepay](./gatepay): It's the main microservice. It allows to create, refund and get payments.

## Pre-requisites and justifications

1. [go1.22][5]: I used go1.22 to build the API because it's the last stable version of go.
2. [enumer][6]: enumer allows to simplify the creation of enums in go. It creates the methods to work with SQL and JSON.
3. [gorilla/mux][8]: A powerful URL router and dispatcher for golang.
4. [logrus][7]: logrus is a structured logger for Go (golang).
5. [postgres][9]: I decided to use postgres because it's a powerful and open-source database. It's also easy to use and has a lot of documentation.
6. [gorm][12]: Simplify the interaction with the database and add speed to the development.
7. [Docker][2]: Docker allows to pack and run the app easier.
8. [Docker Compose][3]: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
9. [Postman][4]: Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.
10. [golangci-lint][10]: golangci-lint is a fast linters runner for Go. It runs linters in parallel, uses caching, and works well with all version of Go.
    - I made a gist to easily install and configure golangci-lint. You can find it [here][11].

## Run with Docker

1. Clone the repository
    - `git clone git@github.com:tecnologer/payment.git deuna-payment`
2. Access the project folder.
   - `cd deuna-payment`
3. Run composer 
   ```shell
   make docker-run-all`
   # or
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
## Run manually

1. Clone the repository and access the project folder.
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:tecnologer/payment.git deuna-payment
   cd deuna-payment
   ```
2. Build and Run the [auth](./auth) microservice
   ```shell
    make build-auth 
    # Default port is 8080, if you want to change it, you can use the ATH_PORT env var.   
    make run-auth ATH_PORT=8080
    ``` 
3. Run the [bank](./bank) microservice 
   ```shell
   make build-bank
   # Default port is 8081, if you want to change it, you can use the BANK_PORT env var.
   # If auth is running in a different port, you can use the AUTH_PORT env var.
   make run-bank BANK_PORT=8081 ATH_PORT=8080
    ``` 
4. Create the database with Docker
   ```shell
   make docker-create-db LOCAL_DB=gatepay \
                         LOCAL_DB_USER=postgres \
                         LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD=S3cret*_2024 \
                         LOCAL_DB_HOST=localhost \
                         LOCAL_DB_PORT=5432 \
                         DB_CONTAINER=gatepay-db
    ``` 
5. Configure Env Vars, Example:
   ```shell
    export DB_PORT=5432
    export DB_HOST=localhost
    export DB_PASSWORD=S3cret*_2024
    export DB_USER=postgres
    export DB_NAME=gatepay
    export DB_SSL_MODE=disable
   ```
6. Build and Run the [migrations](./gatepay/migrator)
   ```shell
   make build-migrator 
   make run-migrator
   ``` 
7. Run the [gatepay](./gatepay) microservice
   ```shell
   make build-gatepay
   # Default port is 8082, if you want to change it, you can use the GATEPAY_PORT env var.
   # If auth and bank are running in a different port, 
   # you can use the AUTH_PORT and BANK_PORT env vars.
   make run-gatepay BANK_PORT=8081 ATH_PORT=8080
    ``` 

## Usage

Use the postman collection for more details on how to use the API.

1. Open Postman
2. Import the collection `postman_collection.json`. More info [here][1].
